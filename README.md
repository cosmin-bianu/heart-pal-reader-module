# Heart Pal - Data Reading

This is the module for reading the data from the prototype. This is part of the Heart Pal project.

## Getting Started

Our prototype is comprised of three modules:
```
-> Raspberry Pi Zero
-> ADS1110 Analogue to Digital Converter
-> Sparkfun Heart Monitoring Module
```

You will need to wire up the device which is done as following:
(to be added soon)


### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java 1.8 installed on the Raspberry Pi Zero.
If you use Raspbian, it should come with Java preinstalled.

## Deployment

You will want to run the JAR file on startup with the other software because the project is made in such manner that it displays everything on a smartphonethat has the app installed. We suggest registering a service and enabling the service to run on startup using systemctl. If you don't know how to do any of that read [this great tutorial](https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6).
